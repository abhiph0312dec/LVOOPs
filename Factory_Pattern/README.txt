Provide a way to initialize the value on a parent wire with data from many different child classes based on some input value, such as a selector ring value, enum, or string input. This may include dynamically loading new child classes into memory. Ideally new child classes can be created and used without editing the framework.

Data comes from many sources – user interface, network connection, hardware – in a raw form. This data frequently comes in types, and the data is to be handled generically but each type has a specific behavior at the core of the handling. Such a problem cries out for the use of classes and dynamic dispatching. We want to write an algorithm around some common parent type and then let dynamic dispatching choose the correct subVI implementation for the parts of the algorithm that are type specific. The hard part is in initializing the right class from the input data.
