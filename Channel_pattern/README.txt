To provide a guaranteed pre-processing/post-processing around some dynamic central functionality. Allows child classes the ability to override some steps of an algorithm without giving them the ability to change out the entire algorithm.

You have a class hierarchy. And you have some algorithm that you want to implement on the parent class. There is a core step of the algorithm that needs to be dynamic dispatch so that each child class can provide its own behavior. But it is unsafe to call that step directly â€“ there are pre-conditions that must be checked or post-conditions you want to enforce. So you need an interface that guarantees the core is only called from a particular entry point.
